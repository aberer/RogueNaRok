/*  RogueNaRok is an algorithm for the identification of rogue taxa in a set of phylogenetic trees. 
 *
 *  Moreover, the program collection comes with efficient implementations of 
 *   * the unrooted leaf stability by Thorley and Wilkinson
 *   * the taxonomic instability index by Maddinson and Maddison
 *   * a maximum agreement subtree implementation (MAST) for unrooted trees 
 *   * a tool for pruning taxa from a tree collection.
